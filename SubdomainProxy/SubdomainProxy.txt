How to add subdomain proxy to Apache Ubuntu (commands)

1.	Create a new configuration file for the virtual host by creating a new file in the /etc/apache2/sites-available directory. You can name the file anything you like, but it's a good idea to use a descriptive name that relates to the virtual host you are creating: 
sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/ hostname.server.com.conf
2. Add the following configuration to the file:
  <VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName hostname.server.com
    ProxyPreserveHost On
    ProxyPass / http://server.ip:server-port/
    ProxyPassReverse / http://server.ip:server-port/
</VirtualHost>
3. Save the file and exit the text editor.
4. Enable the virtual host by creating a symbolic link to the file you just created in the /etc/apache2/sites-enabled directory. You can use the following command to do this:
sudo ln -s /etc/apache2/sites-available/hostname.server.com.conf   /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/ 
5. Restart Apache: sudo systemctl restart apache2
6. Enable proxy : sudo a2enmod proxy
6.1 Restart apache: sudo systemctl restart apache2
7. Enable http proxy module: sudo a2enmod proxy_http
       7.1 Restart apache: sudo systemctl restart apache2

Just to know:

Steps 6,6.1,7 are only for first time enabling (new server, etc.)

Steps 1,2,3,4,5,7.1 are for every VirtualHost (subdomain) you want to add
